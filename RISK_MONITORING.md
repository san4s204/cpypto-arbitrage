# Risk Monitoring Checklist

## Daily Monitoring Tasks

### System Health
- [ ] Check all microservices are running (via dashboard or `docker-compose ps`)
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connections to all exchanges are active
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space)
- [ ] Check for any error spikes in logs
- [ ] Verify Redis and PostgreSQL are functioning properly

### Financial Metrics
- [ ] Review daily PnL performance
- [ ] Check balance distribution across exchanges
- [ ] Verify no unusual withdrawal activity
- [ ] Monitor fee expenditure is within expected ranges
- [ ] Check for any stuck or pending transfers

### Trading Performance
- [ ] Review number of arbitrage opportunities detected
- [ ] Analyze execution success rate
- [ ] Check average profit margin per trade
- [ ] Monitor slippage between detected and executed prices
- [ ] Verify trade volume is within configured limits

### Security
- [ ] Check for any unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Verify API key permissions haven't changed
- [ ] Monitor for any unusual IP access patterns
- [ ] Check Telegram bot is only responding to authorized users
- [ ] Verify encryption of sensitive data is intact

## Weekly Monitoring Tasks

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Generate weekly PnL report
- [ ] Analyze most profitable pairs and exchanges
- [ ] Review system latency metrics
- [ ] Check for patterns in failed executions
- [ ] Evaluate capital efficiency across exchanges

### Risk Assessment
- [ ] Review volatility patterns in traded pairs
- [ ] Check for any exchange policy changes
- [ ] Evaluate network transfer times between exchanges
- [ ] Review any market events that could impact arbitrage
- [ ] Assess liquidity changes in key trading pairs

### System Maintenance
- [ ] Backup PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Check for any software updates needed
- [ ] Verify backup procedures are working
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures

## Monthly Monitoring Tasks

### Strategic Review
- [ ] Comprehensive PnL analysis for the month
- [ ] Review trading parameters for optimization
- [ ] Evaluate adding/removing exchanges or trading pairs
- [ ] Assess capital allocation strategy
- [ ] Review fee structures across exchanges

### Compliance and Security
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Update IP whitelists if needed
- [ ] Review exchange terms of service for any changes
- [ ] Check for any regulatory developments
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit

## Key Metrics to Track

### Latency Metrics
- Market data refresh rate (target: <100ms)
- Opportunity detection time (target: <200ms)
- Order execution time (target: <500ms)
- End-to-end execution time (target: <2s)

### Error Rates
- WebSocket disconnection rate (target: <0.1%)
- Failed order rate (target: <1%)
- Failed transfer rate (target: <0.5%)
- API rate limit hits (target: 0)

### Financial Metrics
- Daily PnL
- PnL per trade
- ROI percentage
- Fee percentage of profit
- Capital utilization rate

### Operational Metrics
- Uptime percentage
- Number of opportunities detected
- Number of trades executed
- Average profit margin
- Telegram notification delivery time

## Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Action |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Service downtime | >5 minutes | >15 minutes | Restart service, check logs |
| WebSocket disconnections | >5 per hour | >20 per hour | Check network, rotate IP if needed |
| Failed orders | >5% | >10% | Pause trading, investigate |
| API rate limit | >80% | >95% | Reduce request frequency |
| Unusual withdrawal | Any | Any | Pause system, verify security |
| Negative daily PnL | Any | >$100 | Review trading parameters |
| High latency | >500ms | >1s | Check network, optimize code |
| Database size | >80% | >90% | Clean old data, add storage |

## Emergency Procedures

### System Failure
1. Stop all trading activities: `docker-compose stop arb_engine execution`
2. Assess the situation and check logs
3. Fix the issue or restore from backup
4. Restart services: `docker-compose up -d`
5. Verify system is functioning properly before enabling trading

### Security Breach
1. Immediately stop all services: `docker-compose down`
2. Revoke all API keys on exchanges
3. Change all passwords and access credentials
4. Investigate the breach and identify the vulnerability
5. Apply security patches and restore from clean backup
6. Create new API keys with proper restrictions
7. Restart with heightened monitoring

### Exchange Issues
1. Disable the problematic exchange in configuration
2. Rebalance funds to active exchanges if needed
3. Monitor the situation and exchange status
4. Re-enable when the exchange is stable

### Network Transfer Failures
1. Check the status of the blockchain network
2. Verify transaction status on block explorers
3. Contact exchange support if needed
4. Consider using alternative networks for transfers
5. Update network preferences in configuration
